        <p><strong>Ukrainian cuisine</strong> is the collection of the various cooking traditions of Ukrainian people accumulated over many years. The cuisine is heavily influenced by the <em>rich dark soil (chornozem)</em> from which its ingredients come and often involves many components.</p>
        <p>Ukraine is often referred to as the <strong>“breadbasket of Europe”</strong> because of how much the Ukrainian people value wheat and grain - a staple in Ukrainian cuisine due to their historical relationship with it. </p>
        <p>Being one of the best places in the world for agriculture, grains and vegetables have long played an important role in Ukrainian cuisine. Breads made from rye or wheat flour are a centerpiece on every Ukrainian dinner table while vegetables like <em>potatoes, carrots, pumpkin, tomatoes, and corn</em> make their way into many traditional Ukrainian recipes.</p>
